                            <p>Process is a designer's lifeline.</p>
                            <p>While I often need to tweak, here is the backbone I rely on.</p>
                        </div>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <figure class="diagram">
                                </figure>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Discover</h5>
                                <div>
                                    They say 'starting is half the battle'. This is the time when you first get a taste of a project, get in touch with the stakeholders, learn about the vision, the strategy, the issues, the needs. How? Focus Groups, Interviews & Surveys, Usability Audits,
                                    Usability Goals, Gap Assesments, Requirement Gathering and more.
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Define</h5>
                                <div>
                                    Now you need to extract, process and refine information you have discovered into Storyboards, User Profiles, Requirement Analysis, User Experience Definitions, Benchmarking ... You have to establish what your role and efforts will be. These are foundations
                                    for any good work you can do on a project. If you won't talk to people, don't be a designer.
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Design</h5>
                                <div>
                                    You now know enough to start producing. Designing Wireframes, Prototypes, making fully functional Designs or just Concepts, this is where you start formulating solutions to needs. And, honestly, it is a really fun step.
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Develop</h5>
                                <div>
                                    It's time to bring ideas to life. A good design is nothing without thoughtful execution. So make sure you dot all your "i"s and cross all your "t"s. Seriously, typos in code are the devil.
                                </div>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h5>Deploy</h5>
                                <div>
                                    You have made it this far, which means you probably had to test something in Internet Explorer, for which you deserve a pat on the back. Yet the work is not over. You need to check that all is going according to plan. Data is key. Do your A/B Testing,
                                    User Testing, User Interviews, stare at your Analytics. If you see issues, time to go back a few steps, as far as you need to understand where your product is lacking. Now, is all looking good? Hold on, there's one more
                                    step left.
                                </div>

                                <div>
                                    "Time Always Wins". So you've got a kick-ass product that everyone loves... for now. People change, markets transform, companies adapt, customers sway and needs evolve. Keep your eyes on your metrics (and your competitors), talk to your users, and go
                                    back to the brainstorm and/or drawing boards when needed. But maybe have a beer first — #treatyoself.

                                <p>As a designer, I create material. Experience is users' subjective reactions to my creations. My work is only as good as they think it is.</p>

                                <p>Good design stands the test of time, and is to be changed only when necessary, but should be absolutely changed when necessary. Equally, stability is required to give users time to learn how to incrementally do more and better
                                    with the same product.</p>

                                <p>Be it survey feedback, live testing, interviews, any information exchanged with users contains signals and potential breakthroughs to better a design.</p>

                                <p>‘Minimalist’, ‘pure’, ‘organic’ designs are not what will satisfy users. <em>Clarity</em> is what they need. Be honest and accessible in your design, not to show off your skills or indulge your taste, but because it helps the
                                    user.

                                <h5><span>7</span> It's The Economy, Stupid!</h5>
                                <p>A great design should always aim to better an experience, and one of the consequences should be and influx of users or a growth in demand. If no one is using a product, there are questions to ask about its design.</p>

                                <p>A happy designer is a better designer. To have the patience, the openness, the empathy needed, we must first take care of ourselves and make sure we’re happy before making things for others.</p>

                                    <p>I was challenged by Booking B.V. to find actionable changes to quickly deploy to their main website.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="discover">
                                    <h5>Discover</h5>
                                    <p>I browsed Booking.com extensively on multiple platforms (large, medium and small screens).</p>
                                    <p>I soon discovered that while on the large-viewport version of their homepage they are pushing for the installation of their mobile app in 4 different locations in 4 different ways, they are not adverstising it as strongly
                                        on smaller screens/mobile devices.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Furthering my research, I compared their choices to their main competitor, Expedia.</p>
                                    <p>Compared to Booking.com, on Expedia.com mobile version the "install our mobile application" section is placed higher in the page. Its design incorportates mobile app stores graphics, allowing for easy purpose identification
                                        by visitors. In contrast, Booking.com chose not to use any visual clues that this is indeed an opportunity to install their mobile app, and relies instead on the text content alone.

                                    <p>As of now, mobile applications offer unique ways to interact with users that websites cannot provide : integration with mobile devices OSes (dashboards, sharing capabilities, access to device data), notifications, payment
                                        integrations, better data storage capabilities, better persistent authentication as well better visual presentation and performance. All things equal, these capabilities allow companies to provide an all-together better
                                        experience to users, translating into a larger share of users becoming "convertible" and a higher conversion rate. </p>
                                    <p>For these reasons, it makes sense to push for installation of a mobile app on large viewports, and it makes even more sense to promote this to users viewing Booking.com on their mobile devices, as the path to installation
                                        is direct and much shorter, on average 3 taps.

                                    <p>A friend of mine complained he was finding routing/itinerary services confusing to use.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> He also wanted to be able to use the same interface on any device, without having to install applications.
                                    </p>
                                    <p> I looked at Google Map services, Apple Map services and local competitors, yet I could not find an interface with the level of simplicity that my friend required.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>I first discussed my friend’s issues with other itinerary assistant options (mobile applications, websites).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I took in his requirements and I drew a simple interface, explaining to him how I could use Google APIs to improve the quality of his experience (auto-complete, ability to go from any address to any address, contextual
                                        information on itineraries, updates on disturbances…).
                                    </p>

                                    <p>On the left, a 75% width column contains a Google Maps interactive map (of Paris, by default). The map has custom styles to soften map features and make the public transport layer more visible.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>On the right is a form, where you can input departure and arrival locations in two text fields. Both fields have auto-complete.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>You then select a departure time, or leave the default option which is a departure within the next 15 minutes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>When the user clicks “Find Itinerary”, routes are displayed in a list format as well as on the interactive map.

                                    <p>I noticed that although he used the product succesfully, he was required to manually choose the departure time using the select menu all the way from “00:00” to his desired depature time, even when he wanted to leave immediately.</p>
                                    <p>I subsequently update the code to include a time selection function that selects the next quarter hour as default departure time, eliminating 2 taps in that use case.

                        <p>
                            I’m a people-lover, a communicator, an unabashed optimist and a curious experimenter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This explains my passion for languages, my 3 majors in English, Journalism and Digital Design, my venture in Startups and Social Media, my thirst for Art in all its manifestations and my love of all things running on silicium.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My career path might surprise you, yet I’m incredibly grateful for the wonderful opportunities, the fun I have had along the way, and all I have learnt with the great people I’ve worked with.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a designer & a person, I believe that we are capable of more than we think, we deserve to live surrounded by beauty, trust and empathy are the foundation of any project worth undertaking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Operationally, I have an eye for proportions, placement, alignments, typography and color schemes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            UX, UI, IA, IxD are not interchangeable, but I can wield all four, and more. I believe in an holistic approach to projects, good design is achieved through comprehensive solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through my ventures, I have acquired valuable peripheral skills allowing me to work well with other specialists, for instance in social media, communication, copywriting, servers/hosting, networking and even advertising.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having run a start-up business taught me what cash-flow, working capital and bottom-line mean, therefore I quickly understand how any stake in a project might affect a business.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, I am always curious to read on and try the latest API, design software, programming language or modelling pattern, I can't help it !
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On my own time, I love to watch silly TV and cook/eat ridiculously spicy food ■
